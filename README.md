<h2>Description</h2>

In this walkthrough/tutorial I am setting up and using a Virtual Private Network in Windows using the free ProtonVPN app.
In my case I did so within a Virtual Machine I had created in Microsoft Azure. A VPN is a technology that allows you to create a secure connection over the internet. This provides privacy and security by encrypting your network traffic and routing it through servers located in different geographical locations. <br /> 


<h2>Search for VPN website</h2>

Before getting to the last part, you can also look at your IP Address before connecting to VPN and see that it changed when connecting, here I used the website www.whatismyip.com to check my IP Address before using VPN

Once at this screen after logging in, you are now able to connect to any of the free locations/servers. In this example, I used a Japanese server. Hover over the down arrow and it should say connect next to it.

Hit connect and you are now connected to server with VPN.

You can now check your IP Address back on www.whatismyip.com and see that your location is now in the area of the server location you chose. You are now set up and are using VPN.
